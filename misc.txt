## Documentation

ยง.3.1 Jupyter Notebooks

The docs/ folder contains Jupyter notebooks, ... TODO

ยง.3.2 Sphinx Docs

Some of the documentation is in the form of ReST files

ยง.3.3 Building the Docs

Building the documentation is a little tricky at the moment.  It involves
a makefile that uses nbconvert to generate ReST files from some of the
notebooks, copies those to the sphinx source dir, then builds the HTML
output using sphinx.

Get the dependencies for (re)building the docs:

    pip install Thun[build-docs]
    make docs








Nothing is done about Python exceptions currently, although it would be
possible to capture the stack and expression just before the exception
and build a robust and flexible error handler.  Because they are both
just datastructures, you could immediately retry them under a debugger,
or edit either or both of the stack and expression.  All state is in one
or the other.
