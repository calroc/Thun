(I had the Python package set up to upload to PyPI as "Thun", but the
whole Python distribution story seems unsettled at the moment (2023) so
I've gone back to the *old ways*: there is a single script ``joy.py``
that gets modified (``defs.txt`` is inserted) to create a ``joy`` script
that uses the "shebang" trick to pretend to be a binary.  In other words,
run ``make`` and put the resulting ``joy`` script in your PATH, if that's
what you want to do.  In a year or two the Python folks will have sorted
things out and we can go back to ``pip install Thun`` or whatever.)
