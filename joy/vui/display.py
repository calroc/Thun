Display
=================

This module implements a simple visual display system modeled on Oberon.

Refer to Chapter 4 of the Project Oberon book for more information.

There is a Display object that manages a pygame surface and N vertical
tracks each of which manages zero or more viewers.

class Display(object):
	'''
	Manage tracks and viewers on a screen (Pygame surface.)

	The size and number of tracks are defined by passing in at least two
	ratios, e.g. Display(screen, 1, 4, 4) would create three tracks, one
	small one on the left and two larger ones of the same size, each four
	times wider than the left one.

	All tracks take up the whole height of the display screen.  Tracks
	manage zero or more Viewers.  When you "grow" a viewer a new track is
	created that overlays or hides one or two existing tracks, and when
	the last viewer in an overlay track is closed the track closes too
	and reveals the hidden tracks (and their viewers, if any.)

	In order to facilitate command underlining while mouse dragging the
	lookup parameter must be a function that accepts a string and returns
	a Boolean indicating whether that string is a valid Joy function name.
	Typically you pass in the __contains__ method of the Joy dict.  This
	is a case of breaking "loose coupling" to gain efficiency, as otherwise
	we would have to e.g. send some sort of lookup message to the
	World context object, going through the whole Display.broadcast()
	machinery, etc.  Not something you want to do on each MOUSEMOTION
	event.
