When talking about Joy we use the terms "stack", "quote", "sequence",
"list", and others to mean the same thing: a simple linear datatype that
permits certain operations such as iterating and pushing and popping
values from (at least) one end.

There is no "Stack" Python class, instead we use the  `cons list`_, a 
venerable two-tuple recursive sequence datastructure, where the
empty tuple ``()`` is the empty stack and ``(head, rest)`` gives the
recursive form of a stack with one or more items on it::

    stack := () | (item, stack)

Putting some numbers onto a stack::

    ()
    (1, ())
    (2, (1, ()))
    (3, (2, (1, ())))
    ...

Python has very nice "tuple packing and unpacking" in its syntax which
means we can directly "unpack" the expected arguments to a Joy function.

For example::

	def dup((head, tail)):
		return head, (head, tail)

We replace the argument "stack" by the expected structure of the stack,
in this case "(head, tail)", and Python takes care of unpacking the
incoming tuple and assigning values to the names.  (Note that Python
syntax doesn't require parentheses around tuples used in expressions
where they would be redundant.)

Unfortunately, the Sphinx documentation generator, which is used to generate this
web page, doesn't handle tuples in the function parameters.  And in Python 3, this
syntax was removed entirely.  Instead you would have to write::

	def dup(stack):
		head, tail = stack
		return head, (head, tail)


We have two very simple functions, one to build up a stack from a Python
iterable and another to iterate through a stack and yield its items
one-by-one in order.  There are also two functions to generate string representations
of stacks.  They only differ in that one prints the terms in stack from left-to-right while the other prints from right-to-left.  In both functions *internal stacks* are
printed left-to-right.  These functions are written to support :doc:`../pretty`.
