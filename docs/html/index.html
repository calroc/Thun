<h1>Thun</h1>
<p>A Dialect of Joy.</p>
<p>Version 0.5.0</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simple pleasures are the best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_%28programming_language%29">Joy</a> is a
programming language created by Manfred von Thun that is easy to use and
understand and has many other nice properties.  <strong>Thun</strong> is a dialect of
Joy that attempts to stay very close to the spirit of Joy but does not
precisely match the behaviour of the original version written in C.  It
started as a Python project called Joypy, but after someone claimed the
name on PyPI before me I renamed it to Thun in honor of Manfred Von Thun
who created Joy.</p>
<p>Joy is:</p>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming">Purely Functional</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming_language">Stack-based</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language">Concatinative</a>

</ul>
<p>The best source (no pun intended) for learning about Joy is the
information made available at the
<a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/research/research-projects/past-projects/joy-programming-language">website of La Trobe University</a>
| <a href="https://www.kevinalbrecht.com/code/joy-mirror/">(mirror)</a>
which contains source code for the original C interpreter, Joy language source code for various functions,
and a great deal of fascinating material mostly written by Von Thun on
Joy and its deeper facets as well as how to program in it and several
interesting aspects.  It's quite a treasure trove.</p>

<h2>Differences of Thun to Joy</h2>
<p>Thun currently only uses four datatypes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integers, these are signed and are not bounded by machine word
  length (they are
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">bignums</a>.)</li>
<li>Boolean values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Lists quoted in <strong>[</strong> and <strong>]</strong> brackets.</li>
<li>Symbols (names).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thun works by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">Continuation Passing Style</a>.</p>
<p>Something else I can't remember at the mo'.</p>
<h2>Example Code</h2>
<p>Here is an example of Joy code:</p>
<pre><code>square_spiral [_p] [_then] [_else] ifte

_p  [_p0] [_p1] &amp;&amp;
_p0 [abs] ii &lt;=
_p1 [&lt;&gt;] [pop !-] ||

_then [    !-] [[++]] [[--]] ifte dip
_else [pop !-]  [--]   [++]  ifte
</code></pre>
<p>It might seem unreadable but with a little familiarity it becomes just as legible as any other notation.</p>
<p>This function accepts two integers on the stack and increments or
decrements one of them such that the new pair of numbers is the next
coordinate pair in a square spiral (like the kind used to construct an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral">Ulam Spiral</a>
).  For more information see <a href="/notebooks/Square_Spiral.html">Square Spiral Example Joy Code</a></p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<h3><a href="/notebooks/index.html">Jupyter Notebooks</a></h3>
<h3><a href="/FuncRef.html">Function Reference</a></h3>
<h3>Building the Docs</h3>
<p>Run <code>make</code> in the <code>docs</code> directory.  (This is a lie, it's more complex than
that.  Really you need to run (GNU) make in the <code>docs/notebooks</code> and
<code>docs/reference</code> dirs first, <em>then</em> run <code>make</code> in the <code>docs</code> directory.)</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Clone the repo and follow the instructions in the individual <code>implementations</code> directories.</p>
<h2>Basics of Joy</h2>
<p>Joy is built around three things: a <strong>stack</strong> of data items, an <strong>expression</strong>
representing a program to evaluate, and a <strong>dictionary</strong> of named functions.</p>
<p>Joy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming_language">stack-based</a>.
There is a single main <strong>stack</strong> that holds data items, which can be integers, bools,
symbols (names), or sequences of data items enclosed in square brackets (<code>[</code> or <code>]</code>).</p>
<pre><code>23 dup [21 18 add] true false [1 [2 [3]]] cons
</code></pre>
<p>A Joy <strong>expression</strong> is just a sequence or list of items.  Sequences
intended as programs are called "quoted programs".  Evaluation proceeds
by iterating through the terms in an expression putting all literals (integers, bools, or lists)
onto the main stack and executing functions named by symbols as they are encountered.
Functions receive the current stack, expression, and dictionary and return the next stack.</p>
<p>The <strong>dictionary</strong> associates symbols (strings) with Joy expressions that define the
available functions of the Joy system.  Together the stack, expression, and dictionary
are the entire state of the Joy interpreter.</p>
<h3>Interpreter</h3>
<p><img alt="joy_interpreter_flowchart.svg" src="/joy_interpreter_flowchart.svg"></p>
<h3>Stack / Quote / List / Sequence</h3>
<p>When talking about Joy we use the terms "stack", "quote", "sequence",
"list", and others to mean the same thing: a simple linear datatype that
permits certain operations such as iterating and pushing and popping
values from (at least) one end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In describing Joy I have used the term quotation to describe all of the
above, because I needed a word to describe the arguments to combinators
which fulfill the same role in Joy as lambda abstractions (with
variables) fulfill in the more familiar functional languages. I use the
term list for those quotations whose members are what I call literals:
numbers, characters, truth values, sets, strings and other quotations.
All these I call literals because their occurrence in code results in
them being pushed onto the stack. But I also call [London Paris] a list.
So, [dup *] is a quotation but not a list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10000350">"A Conversation with Manfred von Thun" w/ Stevan Apter</a></p>
<h3>Literals and Simple Functions</h3>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3>Combinators</h3>
<p>The main loop is very simple as most of the action happens through what
are called <strong>combinators</strong>. These are functions which accept quoted programs on the
stack and run them in various ways.  These combinators reify specific
control-flow patterns (such as <code>ifte</code> which is like <code>if.. then.. else..</code> in other
languages.)  Combinators receive the current
expession in addition to the stack and return the next expression.  They
work by changing the pending expression the interpreter is about to
execute.  (The combinators could work by making recursive calls to the
interpreter and all intermediate state would be held in the call stack of
the implementation language, in this joy implementation they work instead
by changing the pending expression and intermediate state is put there.)</p>
