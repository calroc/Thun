<h1>Thun</h1>
<p>A Dialect of Joy.</p>
<p>Version 0.5.0</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simple pleasures are the best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_%28programming_language%29">Joy</a> is a
programming language created by Manfred von Thun that is easy to use and
understand and has many other nice properties.  <strong>Thun</strong> is a dialect of
Joy that attempts to stay very close to the spirit of Joy but does not
precisely match the behaviour of the original version written in C.  It
started as a Python project called "Joypy", but after someone claimed
that name on PyPI before me I renamed it to Thun in honor of Manfred Von
Thun. Now there are interpreters implemented in several additional
languages (C, Elm, Nim, OCaml, Prolog, and Scheme).</p>
<p>Joy is:</p>

<p>The best source for learning about Joy is the information made available
at the <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/research/research-projects/past-projects/joy-programming-language">website of La Trobe University</a>
| <a href="https://www.kevinalbrecht.com/code/joy-mirror/">(mirror)</a> which
contains source code for the original C interpreter, Joy language source
code for various functions, and a great deal of fascinating material
mostly written by Von Thun on Joy and its deeper facets as well as how to
program in it and several interesting aspects.  It's quite a treasure
trove.</p>

<h2>Example Code</h2>
<p>Here is an example of Joy code.  This function <code>square_spiral</code> accepts
two integers and increments or decrements one of them such that the new
pair of numbers is the next coordinate pair in a square spiral (like the
kind used to construct an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral">Ulam Spiral</a>).
For more information see <a href="notebooks/Square_Spiral.html">Square Spiral Example Joy Code</a>.</p>
<pre><code>square_spiral [p] [then] [else] ifte

p  [p0] [p1] and
p0 [abs] ii &lt;=
p1 [&lt;&gt;] [pop !-] or

then [    !-] [[++]] [[--]] ifte dip
else [pop !-]  [--]   [++]  ifte
</code></pre>
<p>It might seem unreadable but with familiarity it becomes as legible as
any other notation.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The <a href="Thun.html">Thun specification</a> document describes the Thun dialect,
however most of the
documentation is in the form of <a href="notebooks/index.html">Jupyter Notebooks</a>
that go into more detail.</p>
<p><strong><a href="notebooks/index.html">Jupyter Notebooks</a></strong></p>
<p>There's also a <a href="FuncRef.html">Function Reference</a> that lists each
function and combinator by name and gives a brief description.  (It's
usually out of date, I'm working on it.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="FuncRef.html">Function Reference</a></strong></p>
<h2>Basics of Joy</h2>
<p>The original Joy has several datatypes (such as strings and sets)
but the Thun dialect currently only uses four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integers, signed and unbounded by machine word length (they are
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">bignums</a>.)</li>
<li>Boolean values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Lists quoted in <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> brackets.</li>
<li>Symbols (names).</li>
</ul>
<p>Joy is built around three things: a <strong>stack</strong> of data items, an <strong>expression</strong>
representing a program to evaluate, and a <strong>dictionary</strong> of named functions.</p>
<h3>Stack</h3>
<p>Joy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming_language">stack-based</a>.
There is a single main <strong>stack</strong> that holds data items, which can be integers, bools,
symbols (names), or sequences of data items enclosed in square brackets (<code>[</code> or <code>]</code>).</p>
<p>We use the terms "stack", "quote", "sequence",
"list", and others to mean the same thing: a simple linear datatype that
permits certain operations such as iterating and pushing and popping
values from (at least) one end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In describing Joy I have used the term quotation to describe all of the
above, because I needed a word to describe the arguments to combinators
which fulfill the same role in Joy as lambda abstractions (with
variables) fulfill in the more familiar functional languages. I use the
term list for those quotations whose members are what I call literals:
numbers, characters, truth values, sets, strings and other quotations.
All these I call literals because their occurrence in code results in
them being pushed onto the stack. But I also call [London Paris] a list.
So, [dup *] is a quotation but not a list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10000350">"A Conversation with Manfred von Thun" w/ Stevan Apter</a></p>
<h3>Expression</h3>
<p>A Joy <strong>expression</strong> is just a sequence or list of items.  Sequences
intended as programs are called "quoted programs".  Evaluation proceeds
by iterating through the terms in an expression putting all literals
(integers, bools, or lists) onto the main stack and executing functions
named by symbols as they are encountered.  Functions receive the current
stack, expression, and dictionary and return the next stack, expression,
and dictionary.</p>
<h3>Dictionary</h3>
<p>The <strong>dictionary</strong> associates symbols (names) with Joy expressions that
define the available functions of the Joy system.  Together the stack,
expression, and dictionary are the entire state of the Joy interpreter.</p>
<h3>Interpreter</h3>
<p>The Joy interpreter is extrememly simple. It accepts a stack, an
expression, and a dictionary, and it iterates through the expression
putting values onto the stack and delegating execution to functions which
it looks up in the dictionary.</p>
<p><img alt="Joy Interpreter Flowchart" src="/joy_interpreter_flowchart.svg"></p>
<p>All control flow works by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">Continuation Passing Style</a>.
<strong>Combinators</strong> (see below) alter control flow by prepending quoted programs to the pending
expression (aka "continuation".)</p>
<hr>
<p>From here it kinda falls apart...</p>
<h3>Literals and Simple Functions</h3>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3>Combinators</h3>
<p>The main loop is very simple as most of the action happens through what
are called <strong>combinators</strong>. These are functions which accept quoted programs on the
stack and run them in various ways.  These combinators reify specific
control-flow patterns (such as <code>ifte</code> which is like <code>if.. then.. else..</code> in other
languages.)  Combinators receive the current
expession in addition to the stack and return the next expression.  They
work by changing the pending expression the interpreter is about to
execute.  (The combinators could work by making recursive calls to the
interpreter and all intermediate state would be held in the call stack of
the implementation language, in this joy implementation they work instead
by changing the pending expression and intermediate state is put there.)</p>
