## floordiv

Basis Function

I don't know why this is called "floor" div, I think it rounds its
result down (not towards zero or up.)

       a b floordiv
    ------------------
          (a/b)

### Discussion

All the division commands need to be revisited when the "numeric tower"
for Thun gets nailed down.
