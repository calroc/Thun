Essays about Programming in Joy
===============================

These essays are adapted from Jupyter notebooks.  I hope to have those hosted somewhere where people can view them "live" and interact with them, possibly on MS Azure.  For now, Sphinx does such a great job rendering the HTML that I am copying over some notebooks in ReST format and hand-editing them into these documents.
