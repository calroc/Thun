    "It would be simple enough to define one, but it would open the door to *name binding* and break the idea that all state is captured in the stack and expression.  There's an implicit *standard dictionary* that defines the actual semantics of the syntactic stack and expression datastructures (which only contain symbols, not the actual functions.  Pickle some and see for yourself.)\n",

There would be a *Grand Refactoring* biannually (two years, not six months, that's semi-annually) where any new definitions factored out of the usage and macros of the previous time, along with new algorithms and such, were entered into the dictionary and posted to e.g. IPFS.\n",

There shouldn't be dozens of chat apps, JS frameworks, programming languages.  It's a waste of time, a [fractal \"thundering herd\" attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem) on human mentality.\n",

The code also works the first time, no bugs.  If you have any experience programming at all, you are probably skeptical, as I was, but it seems to work: deriving code mathematically seems to lead to fewer errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "But my point now is that this great ratio of textual explanation to wind up with code that consists of a few equations and could fit on an index card is highly desirable.  Less code has fewer errors.  The structure of Joy engenders a kind of thinking that seems to be very effective for developing structured processes.\n",
