# Why Scheme?

First of all, it's a Lisp.

Universal (implemented for many platforms, many times.)

Venerable (around for a long time, still going strong.  Roots in deep places.)

Simple.  (Language and implementation.)

Well documented.  (SICP, 'nuff said.  But etc. & et. al.)

Unconventional but uncontroversial.

Compile and REPL.

(Optional strong typing.)

Because it's old and well-used it has everything ("Batteries Included" or
easily available.)

Compact and elegant code.

Ooo!  And it makes a nice _target_ for compiling Joy expressions!

The Numeric Tower!
