# Why Scheme?

First of all, it's a Lisp.

Universal (implemented for many platforms, many times.)

Venerable (around for a long time, still going strong.  Roots in deep places.)

Simple.  (Language and implementation.)

Well documented.  (SICP, 'nuff said.  But etc. & et. al.)

Unconventional but uncontroversial.

Compile and REPL.

(Optional strong typing.)

Because it's old and well-used it has everything ("Batteries Included" or
easily available.)

Compact and elegant code.

Ooo!  And it makes a nice _target_ for compiling Joy expressions!

The Numeric Tower!


I think I've settled on #Scheme the host language for my Xerblin project.  Reasons: It's a Lisp; implemented for many platforms, many times; venerable (around for a long time, still going strong, roots in deep places); simple (language and implementation); Well documented. (SICP, 'nuff said); lots of compilers; libs for everything; compact and elegant code;it makes a nice _target_ for compiling Joy expressions; The Numeric Tower!
