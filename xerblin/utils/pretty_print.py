Pretty printing support, e.g.::

    Joy? 23 18 * 99 +
           . 23 18 mul 99 add
        23 . 18 mul 99 add
     23 18 . mul 99 add
       414 . 99 add
    414 99 . add
       513 . 

    513 <-top

    joy? 

On each line the stack is printed with the top to the right, then a ``.`` to
represent the current locus of processing, then the pending expression to the
left.
