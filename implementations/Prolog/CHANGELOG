-----------------------------------------
Unreleased

Added:

- Some documentation for a few functors.
- A start on regression tests.

Fixed:
- Blanks should parse as null expression.


-----------------------------------------
[-10.0.0] - 2020-2-1

Initial re-release as a Prolog project.  See https://joypy.osdn.io/ for
the original Python 2 project.

Added: 

- Parser & Grammar.
- Semantics (evaluation function.)
- Many functions, combinators,  & definitions.
- Compiler to Prolog.
- (Unfinished) Compiler to machine code.
- Expand/Contract Definitions.
- Formatter (Joy expressions to strings.)
- Partial Reducer (transforms Prolog rules for greater efficiency.)

Removed:

- All the Python code.
- All the Jupyter notebooks.  (I want to rework the content anyway.  The
  originals will remain up on the web at the same URLs (I think the web
  hosting of OSDN allows for setting up 301s though, in case I want to move
  them and redirect.))
- All the GNU Prolog portage ( https://osdn.net/projects/joypy/scm/hg/Joypy/tree/tip/thun/gnu-prolog/ )
  This is another area where i want to rework the content.  It's kind of
  cool to compile Prolog to native code so easily.
