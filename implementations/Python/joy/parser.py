'''
This module exports a single function for converting text to a joy
expression as well as a single Symbol class and a single Exception type.

The Symbol string class is used by the interpreter to recognize literals
by the fact that they are not Symbol objects.

A crude grammar::

    joy = term*
    term = int | float | string | '[' joy ']' | symbol

A Joy expression is a sequence of zero or more terms.  A term is a
literal value (integer, float, string, or Joy expression) or a function
symbol.  Function symbols are unquoted strings and cannot contain square
brackets.   Terms must be separated by blanks, which can be omitted
around square brackets.
