        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
           [if] [then] [rec1 [[if] [then] [rec1] [rec2] genrec] rec2] ifte

    From "Recursion Theory and Joy" (j05cmp.html) by Manfred von Thun:
    "The genrec combinator takes four program parameters in addition to
    whatever data parameters it needs. Fourth from the top is an if-part,
    followed by a then-part. If the if-part yields true, then the then-part
    is executed and the combinator terminates. The other two parameters are
    the rec1-part and the rec2-part. If the if-part yields false, the
    rec1-part is executed. Following that the four program parameters and
    the combinator are again pushed onto the stack bundled up in a quoted
    form. Then the rec2-part is executed, where it will find the bundled
    form. Typically it will then execute the bundled form, either with i or
    with app2, or some other combinator."

    The way to design one of these is to fix your base case [then] and the
    test [if], and then treat rec1 and rec2 as an else-part "sandwiching"
    a quotation of the whole function.

    For example, given a (general recursive) function 'F':
    ::

        F == [I] [T] [R1] [R2] genrec

    If the [I] if-part fails you must derive R1 and R2 from:
    ::

        ... R1 [F] R2

    Just set the stack arguments in front, and figure out what R1 and R2
    have to do to apply the quoted [F] in the proper way.  In effect, the
    genrec combinator turns into an ifte combinator with a quoted copy of
    the original definition in the else-part:
    ::

        F == [I] [T] [R1]   [R2] genrec
          == [I] [T] [R1 [F] R2] ifte

    Primitive recursive functions are those where R2 == i.
    ::

        P == [I] [T] [R] tailrec
          == [I] [T] [R [P] i] ifte
          == [I] [T] [R P] ifte
